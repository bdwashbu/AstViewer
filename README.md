# CEngine
Execute C code on the JVM

Lets not mess with generating JVM bytecode.  Forget the JNI.  Run C directly on the JVM.

Similiar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashorn_(JavaScript_engine) but C instead of JS.

# Dependencies

The C Engine wouldn't be possible without eclipse CDT and JCPP.  The AST generated by CDT is far superior to http://www.antlr.org/.

https://eclipse.org/cdt/
http://www.anarres.org/projects/jcpp/

Supports:
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Variable arguments
- Recursion
- Multilevel pointers
- Function pointers
- All primitive types
- Unsigned primitives
- Memory allocation
- Some standard functions

Testing approach:
Output of C Engine is directly compared to that of GCC. C Engine was bootstrapped off of Java Formatter but it can now execute its own version of printf!

That version is ee_printf and found here:
