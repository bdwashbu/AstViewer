# CEngine
Execute C code on the JVM

Lets not mess with generating JVM bytecode.  Forget the JNI.  Run C directly on the JVM.

Similiar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashorn_(JavaScript_engine) but C instead of JS.

# Dependencies

The C Engine wouldn't be possible without eclipse CDT and JCPP.  The AST generated by CDT is far superior to http://www.antlr.org/.

CDT: https://eclipse.org/cdt/
JCPP: http://www.anarres.org/projects/jcpp/

Supports:
- Pointer aritmetic
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Variable arguments
- Recursion
- Multilevel pointers
- Function pointers
- All C primitive types
- Memory allocation
- Standard functions

Testing approach:
Output of C Engine is directly compared to that of GCC. For a long time C Engine was bootstrapped off of java.util.Formatter https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html but it can now execute an embedded version of printf, ee_printf!

ee_printf is found here:
https://github.com/bwalex/supermips/blob/master/software/coremark/supermips/ee_printf.c
